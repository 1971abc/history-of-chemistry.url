       <h1>History of Chemistry</h1>

       <p>

       Lavoisier wrote the book Elements of Chemistry (1787). 
       He compiles the first complete (at that time) list of elements,
       discovered and named oxygen and hydrogen, helped develop the metric system,
       helped revise and standardize chemical nomenclature and discovered that
       matter retains its mass even when it changes forms.
       Another popular choice for the title of Father of Chemistry is Jabir ibn Hayyan,
       a Persian alchemist living around 800AD who applied scientific principles to his studies.
       Other people sometimes known as the Father of Modern Chemistry are Robert Boyle, 
       Jöns Berzelius and John Dalton.

     <h1 style="margin-top: 5%;"> Base Definition in Chemistry </h1>

      <p>

        In chemistry, a base is a chemical species that donates electrons,
        accepts protons, or releases hydroxide (OH-) ions in aqueous solution.
        Bases display certain characteristic properties that can be used to help identify them.
        They tend to be slippery to the touch (e.g., soap), can taste bitter,
        react with acids to form salts, and catalyze certain reactions. 
        Types of bases include Arrhenius base, Bronsted-Lowry base, and Lewis base.
        Examples of bases include alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, 
        and soap. 

        <h1 style="margin-top: 5%;">Essential Elements for Life</h1>


      <p>

        Of the approximately 115 elements known,
        only the 19 highlighted in purple in Figure 1.9.1 are absolutely required in the human diet.
        These elements—called essential elements—are restricted to the first four rows of the periodic
        table,
        with only two or three exceptions (molybdenum, iodine, and possibly tin in the fifth row).
        Some other elements are essential for specific organisms. For example, 
        boron is required for the growth of certain plants,
        bromine is widely distributed in marine organisms,
        and tungsten is necessary for some microorganisms.

        </p>
        
        <h1 style="margin-top: 5%;">What makes an element “essential”?</h1>

         <p>

          By definition, an essential element is one that is required for life and whose
          absence results in death. Because of the experimental difficulties involved in 
          producing deficiencies severe enough to cause death, especially for elements that
          are required in very low concentrations in the diet, a somewhat broader definition
          is generally used. An element is considered to be essential if a deficiency consistently 
          causes abnormal development or functioning and if dietary supplementation of that
          element—and only that element—prevents this adverse effect. Scientists determine 
          whether an element is essential by raising rats, chicks, and other animals on a synthetic
          diet that has been carefully analyzed and supplemented with acceptable levels of 
          all elements except the element of interest (E). Ultraclean environments, in which
          plastic cages are used and dust from the air is carefully removed, minimize inadvertent 
          contamination. If the animals grow normally on a diet that is as low as possible in E,
          then either E is not an essential element or the diet is not yet below the minimum
          required concentration. If the animals do not grow normally on a low-E diet, then their 
          diets are supplemented with E until a level is reached at which the animals grow normally. 
          This level is the minimum required intake of element E.

       <h1 style="margin-top: 5%;">Most Expensive Natural Element </h1>

       <p>

        The most expensive natural element is francium.
        Although francium occurs naturally, it decays so quickly that it cannot be
        collected for use. Only a few atoms of francium have been produced commercially,
        so if you wanted to produce 100 grams of francium, you could expect to pay a
        few billion U.S. dollars for it. Lutetium is the most expensive element that 
        you could actually order and purchase. The price for 100 grams of lutetium
        is around <strong>$10,000.</strong> So, from a practical standpoint, lutetium is the most expensive element.
